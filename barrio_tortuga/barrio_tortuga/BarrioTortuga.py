Definition of Barrio Tortuga

### Madrid central district:

- Barrio tortuga is modelled as an idealisation of Madrid central district, a neighborhood
(barrio) characterised by:

- Popultion: 131,928 people
- Area: 5.23 km2.
- Number of home: 63,622
- Thus number of people per home ~2

**Barrio Tortuga**

- Toroidal grid of 100 x 100 m2
- Made of square buildings of 30 x 30 m2.
- Between buildings run avenues of 20 m.
- Thus the grid has 4 buildings, 2 avenues running longitudinal and 2 avenues running
horizontal.
- The inhabitable are is 0.6 x 0.6 = 0.36 of the total area
- We assume that each building has 30 apartments. Each apartment has 30 m2.
- We can assume that each building is 10 stories high.
- Thus the number of homes in the patch of the barrio is 30 x 4 = 120 homes.
- The number of turtles in barrio tortuga is 252 (same density that in Madrid center)
   and thus the number of turtles per home is also 2.
